            Our interest in aerial photography began with helicopter and plane flights with our father, George Steinmetz, who is a freelance aerial photographer. In 2015, we started photographing homes around our neighborhood in Glen Ridge, NJ in collaboration with the Glen Ridge Historical Society. A copy of each picture we took was donated to the respective file in the historical archives. As of now, we have photographed a over 400 houses, including major public buildings and schools.

                We both have earned our license from the FAA to fly unmanned aircraft commerically. In 2019, we began working with Amy Owens Realty, taking pictures and making videos of local listing for marketing and social media. Both of us have experiencing photographing large events with outdoor venues, such as birthday parties and high school graduation ceremonies. Although our specialty is still photography, Nick has lots of experience with drone videography, mainly from being an assistant on various trips with his father.
